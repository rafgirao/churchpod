You are an expert in analyzing church services.
Below is a transcript of a service. The service usually follows this order:
1. Opening and Initial Praise (Songs)
2. Announcements and Prayer
3. Preaching/Sermon (The main part, where the pastor expounds the Bible for 20-50 minutes)
4. Invitation, Final Prayer, and Closing

Your task is to identify EXACTLY when the preaching (Sermon) starts and ends.
The preaching usually starts when the pastor asks to open the Bible, cites a biblical text, or goes to the pulpit after the praise.
It ends when he makes the appeal, starts the final prayer, or calls for the closing praise.
